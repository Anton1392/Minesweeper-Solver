# Minesweeper-Solver
A solver for the XP-version of Minesweeper. Made in C#. Takes tens of screenshots per second with color/pixel detection to figure out board state. Then uses game logic to figure which moves are viable and takes control of your mouse to perform these moves.

One of the first major programming projects I made, so code quality may not be up-to-par. :)
